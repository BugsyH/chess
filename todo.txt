Player Input: You need a way to get input from the user. This could be in the form of a command line input where the user enters the current position of the piece they want to move and the position they want to move it to.

Move Validation: Once you have the player's desired move, you need to check if it's a valid move for that type of piece. This involves checking the rules of movement for each type of piece (e.g., a bishop can only move diagonally).

Game State Management: You need to keep track of the state of the game. This includes whose turn it is, whether the king is in check, and whether the game is over (either by checkmate or stalemate).

Move Execution: If the move is valid, you need to update the board to reflect the move. This involves removing the piece from its current position and placing it in the new position.

Display Board: After each move, you should display the updated board to the players.

Here's a rough pseudocode outline of what the main game loop might look like:

while game is not over:
    display board
    get move from current player
    if move is valid:
        execute move
        switch to other player
    else:
        tell player the move was invalid

Implementing these features should give you a basic, playable chess game.


structure

Chess
    handles inputs and game logic

Player
    two player objects that move peices on their turn

Move
    represents a move

Piece
    contains variables for position, type and colour

Board
    draws the current state of the board, handles moves


next
    store postition of peice inside the Peice class, call inside the Board class when drawing the peice
